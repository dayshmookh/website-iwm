                <h2>Airport is gone but not the noise</h2>
                <p>The Bangalore Airport has moved to a new location outside the city. But for the residents near the old Airport, the noise has not gone away. The wind tunnel near the old Airport is being operated quite frequently and the sound — like that of a jet engine — is deafening; and we are more than a mile away from it. For those closer to the wind tunnel, it must be unbearable.</p>
                <p>The wind tunnel was probably installed when there were hardly any residential communities nearby. Now there are a lot of apartments and houses surrounding it. There must be some way to reduce the noise. If not, moving the wind tunnel is the only option. This will be expensive. However, for the sake of the health of the community, this should be considered.</p>

                <h2>Unnecessary Honking and what can be done about it</h2>
                <p>There are those who think that their time is more valuable that that of the pedestrians and honk continuously so that they don’t have to slow down. When the traffic light turns green, they start honking right away. Some of the drivers of call center Tata Sumos and Maruti Omni taxicabs honk continuously even though the traffic is moving at a good clip. At gated apartment complexes, many of drivers can’t wait a few seconds for the guards to lift the barrier pole: they honk. A few months back, in my apartment complex, they put a sign “1000 Rs fine for honking” ($25). I asked the guard if they collected any fine. He said no. I told him “1000 rupees is steep and no one will pay it. You should start with Rs 5.” Offenders can be forced to pay Rs. 5 as it is not much and hopefully they won’t do it again. Honking has reduced but happens a few times each day.</p>
